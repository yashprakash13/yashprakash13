I love to be involved in writing fresh, productive apps that can, even in a small way, simplify a crucial lifestyle task and transform a mental drudgery to a screen-tap respite.  

üî≠ I‚Äôm currently a Software Engineer at DNEG, before that I've worked as a software engineer at [AMD](https://amd.com) on AI based code automation. Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist at [Garvis.ai](https://www.garvis.ai/), a cool startup located in Belgium and we are working to build smart, automated demand forecasting system for supply chains based on data science tools.
