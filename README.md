<h3>I do Data Science and also build Android apps and experiment with Python as a hobby. :computer:  :yellow_heart: </h3>

I love to be involved in writing fresh, productive apps that can, even in a small way, simplify a crucial lifestyle task and transform a mental drudgery to a screen-tap respite.  

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a Computer Science Graduate student at the University of Toronto, and previously, I worked as a Data Scientist at [**Garvis.ai**](https://www.garvis.ai/), a cool startup located in Belgium and we are working to build smart, automated demand forecasting system for supply chains based on data science tools.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m presently learning ... the **Django** way to build awesome websites with Python. I'm also slowly climbing up the hill of Devops for my ML projects. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaborate on ... on any novel idea of an ML application that can change the world.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... solving a problem via machine learning, building a clean Android app architecure or a Python backend for a website 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ... I'm reachable via LinkedIn, Twitter and Mail.
- :book: Visit my software development blog on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ipom). I regularly write for **This Code**, **Towards Data Sciene**, and **Towards AI** publications. 
- âš¡ Fun fact about me: ... I'm addicted to coffee, I enjoy listening to lofi music while I'm coding, I love reading (I devour a book a week) and I love writing fiction. 

#### My favourite technologies to work with are:
Sklearn-Pandas-Plotly-Pytorch, FastAPI, Flask, Django, Docker, Streamlit
